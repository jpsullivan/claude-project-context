title: v1.0
description: Built in CLI for managing your project.
date: 2021-10-01

Version update

Better Auth comes with a built-in CLI to help you manage the database schema needed for both core functionality and plugins.

## Generate

The `generate` command creates the schema required by Better Auth. If you're using a database adapter like Prisma or Drizzle, this command will generate the right schema for your ORM. If you're using the built-in Kysely adapter, it will generate an SQL file you can run directly on your database.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx @better-auth/cli@latest generate
```

### Options

- `--output` - Where to save the generated schema. For Prisma, it will be saved in prisma/schema.prisma. For Drizzle, it goes to schema.ts in your project root. For Kysely, itâ€™s an SQL file saved as schema.sql in your project root.
- `--config` - The path to your Better Auth config file. By default, the CLI will search for a better-auth.ts file in **./**, **./utils**, **./lib**, or any of these directories under `src` directory.
- `--y` - Skip the confirmation prompt and generate the schema directly.

## Migrate

The migrate command applies the Better Auth schema directly to your database. This is available if youâ€™re using the built-in Kysely adapter.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx @better-auth/cli@latest migrate
```

### Options

- `--config` - The path to your Better Auth config file. By default, the CLI will search for a better-auth.ts file in **./**, **./utils**, **./lib**, or any of these directories under `src` directory.
- `--y` - Skip the confirmation prompt and apply the schema directly.

## Common Issues

**Error: Cannot find module X**

If you see this error, it means the CLI canâ€™t resolve imported modules in your Better Auth config file. We're working on a fix for many of these issues, but in the meantime, you can try the following:

- Remove any import aliases in your config file and use relative paths instead. After running the CLI, you can revert to using aliases.

## Secret

The CLI also provides a way to generate a secret key for your Better Auth instance.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx @better-auth/cli@latest secret
```
